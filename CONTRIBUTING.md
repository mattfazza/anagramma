Thanks for wanting to contribute to Anagramma.  I am excited you're here.  Contributing cannot be simpler.  All you need is a MongoDB instance of your own that you can use to fill out the ./config/keys.js file.  Once you do that, you can test everything locally.  

Not much after that.  This is not a big project so I'll review the pull requests myself and I'm excited to see what you come up with.  Have a doubt about anything?  Open an issue.  Have a solution?  Send a PR.

Happy coding!
